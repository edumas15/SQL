My friends and I are big track & field fans and have always been curious when Olympic women started producing better results than 
Olympic men over the same distance. To satiate our curiosity, I wrote this query that determines if the 21st century female would beat
the 20th century male if they went head-to-head. I achieved this with two CTEs and a UNION clause.  

WITH men_results AS (
    SELECT 'M' AS gender, event, year, result, medal
    FROM tfresults
    WHERE event LIKE '%5000M%'
    AND gender = 'M'
    and medal = 'G'
    AND year = '1936'
), women_results AS (
    SELECT 'W' AS gender, event, year, result, medal
    FROM tfresults
    WHERE event LIKE '%5000M%'
    AND gender = 'W'
    AND medal = 'G'
    AND year = '2016'
)
SELECT gender, event, year, result
FROM men_results
UNION ALL
SELECT gender, event, year, result
FROM women_results;
